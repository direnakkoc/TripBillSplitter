## :books: Layers

### Entities Layer
It is the layer where you will represent the database assets of your project, and where you will define these entities as relational database or document-oriented database objects.
This layer is the first entry point during a project development phase. All layers are shaped over a class created here.
I created 3 entities which are User, Trip, and Expense. Additionally, I have an ExpenseDetail class to demonstrate the details of expenses.
